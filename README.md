# Plan 
Make a simulator to be able to see how phisics fields reacts and works.

# Fields
Gravitational
Light

# How
I dont have idea how to do it.

I have to use maths and after getting a 1.5 in the examn im not really sure if im going to be able to.

For general, the phisics will have the next rules:

  ⋅⋅* [Nothing will rotate.]
  ⋅⋅* [2d plane]
  ⋅⋅* [List with all the objects in the simulator.]
  

# Things to do
  ⋅⋅* Colissions
  ⋅⋅* Forces
  ⋅⋅* Movements
  ⋅⋅* Light
  ⋅⋅* Objects
